<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>To the Panasonic Lumix Rewards 2011 contest which will run from 1 November 2011 until 8 January 2012.</p>

<p><span class="bullet">&nbsp;</span>Like last year, this year&rsquo;s contest is again based on <strong>COMPETITIVENESS</strong> as well as <strong>PERFORMANCE</strong>, and you will compete against the peers within your own retail chain. In the end, sixty (60) sales people from across all participating retail chains will be rewarded with fantastic prizes.</p>

<p><span class="bullet">&nbsp;</span>Points can be scored during the ten week contest period by selling Panasonic Lumix cameras, both compact models and G-Series system cameras, as well as movie cameras. You&rsquo;ll find the complete list of all eligible products and their point values in the PDF file you have received upon registering.</p>

<p><span class="bullet">&nbsp;</span>As was the case last year, you will have to <strong>enter your sales online</strong> and keep a copy of all your dockets until the end of the contest for verification. One major change from last year is that you can now earn <strong>20% EXTRA POINTS</strong> when you enter your sales online within ten days of the sales date.</p>

<p><span class="bullet">&nbsp;</span>How the contest works is explained in a few simple steps under &lsquo;the Contest in 1-2-3&rsquo;. However, you can find all detailed information, rules and terms &amp; conditions regarding the contest in the PDF file you received upon registering, or on this website under &lsquo;Terms &amp; Conditions&rsquo;.</p>
